	  <div id="tribute-info"> Marian Cleeves was born in Glendale, California to a family of six. Her father was an English physician, and her mother was a Latin teacher. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1948 from the University of California, Berkeley, she continued on for her graduate studies studying human anatomy. There, she began to teach, and discovered a passion that continued well into her eighties. 
      <br> <br>After working as a research assistant at Harvard University between 1952–53, Diamond became the first woman science instructor at Cornell University from 1955–58 where she taught human biology and comparative anatomy. Diamond returned to the University of California, Berkeley in 1960 in the role of lecturer. By 1964, Diamond had the data and the first actual evidence in anatomical measurements showing the plasticity of the anatomy of the mammalian cerebral cortex. These results "opened the doors for our experiments to follow for the next 37 years." <br><br>

UC Berkeley invited Diamond to be an Assistant Professor in 1965, progressing later to be a full professor, and finally, Professor Emeritus until her death in 2017. In 1984, Diamond and her associates had access to sufficient tissue from Einstein's brain to make the first ever analysis of it, followed by publication of their research. The 1985 paper "On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein" created some controversy in academia over the role of glial cells. However, it also ushered in new interest in neuroglia. </div>
